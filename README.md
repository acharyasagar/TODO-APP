## Simple todo App

It used vanilla JavaScript (no any front-end JAvascript frameworks) and Materialize CSS. It's a simple app where we can add simple todo tasks and remove them when done. Local storage is used to save the data in the browser's storage so the todo list won't go away even after exiting the browser.
